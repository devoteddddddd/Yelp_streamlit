Nice relaxing place to get a massage  Same day appointments are easy to come by  I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center 
Rebecca didn t Doula my birth   BUT  she was our nanny to our first born daughter   Over the months of her being in my home  I realized that I looked forward to talking to her before   after work   I was big   pregnant with Baby     and her information   suggestions hit home with this expectant Momma   She was always easy to talk with  yet honest and extremely truthful    A trait I LOVE       She loves the special role she plays as Doula to laboring woman    She finds beauty and strength in that magical time  Bec would be a great addition to your support team   
I am an amateur athlete  I first met Dr  Ferrel when I was playing softball  He was watching my game when I was severely injured   He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment  I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher s salary  Instead  I saw a physician  He said it would be months before I would play again  Depressed and without much hope  I reached out to Dr  Ferrel again  He did treat me as he promised  Not only did he treat me  he healed me within weeks instead of months  Over the years Dr  Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time  He will always be my hero   
I was a little worried about seeing the reviews but everything  Was great  Not long wait time  Staff was nice from walking in the lobby and asking which way to the office  to the office staff 
My   year old daughter had a severe soar throat  We had seen another fast clinic in a CVS  A few days earlier and recieved a miss diagnosis of a fungus infection  She was prescribed an oral medication that made the condition much worse  We were the only patients at this clinic the entire visit and it took us over   hour  The staff were very robotic like in there behavior  I tried to ask a question on the way out and was told I was not aloud to be there  Very strange since I was already there  It felt like I was being hurried out the door  Keeping in mind there were no other patients in the facility during our visit I was confuses about the wait time and gruf  behaviour  I found the experience to be very unfriendly  It is best to have a good primary care physician and avoid these places at all cost 
I absolutely love this place   Great hours  impeccably clean  so relaxing 
So I no longer go here which is a shame because The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic  I am giving this   stars because when I have contacted for an appointment via the phone  it usually has taken days for me to get a response  The online booking is useless because I rarely have found appointments within   weeks of when I need it  and I m very flexible with time of day     I give up on this place  Unless you book out weeks in advance  you will not get an appointment  I m now paying     more elsewhere which sucks but I m able to get seen when I need to be seen 
LYING SCAMMERS  BAIT AND SWITCH  Will try and take advantage of you  Online coupon says     for unlimited tanning any bed for a week for first time customers  Went to Chippewa location  The lady behind the desk acted like she had no idea what I was talking about  Then I pulled up the coupon and she said it s only for students and that I needed a student ID  However the coupon said nothing about this  Then she switched to saying the coupon is expired  yet it s still on YELP and they re website  She also said they won t honor the     for     coupon you can literally purchase on yelp either  Just bullshit line after bullshit line  I then left And called creve coeur location and the lady there says   yes you can still use that coupon  but you must go to the same location each time for that week once you choose a location   I knew this as my girlfriend used it last week  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE    
The service is super friendly  During my exam  Dr  Dinh was very kind and addressed my concerns  Also  I am very picky when it comes to choosing frames so it was a good thing they had a nice selection to choose from  The receptionist was also very helpful and patient with me during the process haha  Overall experience was great and I will definitely come back for my yearly exam 
I stopped in because I was hungry for some snacks   Browsed the store since I had some spare time and found it to be clean and well stocked   Wide isles  good selection of bakery stuff  flowers and all your usual groceries  I like that they had some locally made snacks too like California Kettle Corn and Taco Works  out of SLO    Found the semi unusual chips I wanted that other stores don t always carry  grabbed a Diet Coke by the checkout and I was happy   Convenient parking lot and the staff was friendly and helpful   Thanks Albertsons 
We see Dr  Gloudemans  and she s a wonderful doctor  Friendly  upbeat  up on the most recent research  and pro vaxx  hooray     She s proactive about problems after making sure things are worth worrying about    let s keep an eye on this  and if there s still a problem in a month or two  come back in and we ll see about a referral to a specialist    As others have mentioned  we ve had a few billing hiccups  We received a bill saying we were past due on   appointments  fees  despite paying all copays in the office  Luckily it was all straightened out after a phone call  but it s been frustrating on that front 
Dr  Curtis Dechant has an excellent chair side manner  and he establishes a good rapport with his patients  The office is very comfortable  and the latest high tech equipment makes eye appointments much easier to bear  I also appreciate their selection of eyeglass frames and the friendly staff 
Always the sweetest ladies  Appointments never take forever and barely any wait time 
I have new dental insurance and had to find a dentist in network and came across Music City Dental  Dr  Spurlin and her staff are great  They are very gentle and make sure the patient is comfortable at all times  I had to get a filling and am terrified of shots  I didn t even feel when Dr  Spurlin gave me my shot  I was offered a pillow  blanket and choice of watching a movie or listening to music  I had a pleasant experience and am definitely a permanent patient 
Platoon is awesome and you definitely want Steve C as a trainer  When I started platoon  I was going once a week and attending a different group exercise class the other days of the week  After a few months  I was only coming to platoon     days a week  I loved how my workouts were customized to what I could do and wanted to do instead of a group workout that was impossible to complete  Steve is a great listener and motivator and sets realistic goals  The staff at platoon are very nice and accommodating  I never had a problem with billing or scheduling 
This hospital is by far the best for families on the East Coast  They make seeing multiple MDs on the same day very easy and the quality of care is incredible  The renovated wing is fantastic with good accommodations for caregivers and friendly and attentive staff  I wholeheartedly recommend A I  DuPont and will continue to travel from NY for my child s care 
Oh my goodness if you ever want to start on a health  trip  this is the place to start  They have so many different vitamins  hence the name   healthy dietary supplements  beauty products and homeopathic items as well  The staff was super helpful in assisting me find some of the items i needed to make my very own moisturizer  They helped me locate the items they had and provided suggestions for items they did not have  They also have a rewards program for frequent shoppers   LOVE THAT  And they accept digital coupons  LOVE THAT TOO 
Wow what a terrible spa  I can only speak for the manicure pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage  Typically  you go to a spa to escape and relax   you can not do that here  It is small  dirty  and the staff is terrible    I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone   he did acknowledge that I was standing there  but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist  Finally  after two other guests came in behind me  someone came up and took me back   just to get me out of the way  Asked what my name was and left  Did not offer me water refreshments of any kind  I ve had better reception at the local nail salon  Then I had to wait for       minutes for my technician to finish up her current client  which I didn t mind because I leisurely picked out my color  When it was my turn  the nail technician was shaky and rushed  She cut my cuticle and I bled  She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt  gross    and took time outs to really blow dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me  Lady  you are touching my hands with yours  you are blowing bacteria into the air  if you are that sick don t come to work    Management  if your employee is that sick do not make them come in  You will lose clients    She gave me the worst hand arm massage I have ever had  that is usually everyone s favorite part  and the technician s opportunity to shine    No pressure was applied  and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just  drinking up all the lotion   Yes  I realize it s dry  probably due to the    degree weather and wind outside  but thank you for making me feel self conscious    When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again  but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there  I opted to put everything on my room charge  which resulted in extra fees but I didn t care  There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room  Yes  everyone prefers cash gratuity   but how tacky can you be?     Overall  it was an extremely disappointing experience  I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon  My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn t even been a week  Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here 
Frank is a great dentist and a very nice guy  He has a gentle manner  takes a sincere interest in his patients and in general is a top quality dentist and person  If you are in the market for a dentist he is an excellent choice  I ve gone to him for years and know many others who have as well 
I went here to get my wisdom teeth out and they did a great job  The only complaint I have is that I never see the same dentist  I ve been going here for   years 
I feel so comfortable with the Mazzoni Center   I  and many others  am incredibly lucky and grateful that these services exist   Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you re assumed to be a certain way   Here  there are no assumptions   They know who they re working with  and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information   If you re in need of gynecology and you re not a woman  for example  they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity   My biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists   I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room   I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger  more private space   If you visit during youth drop in hours rather than making an appointment  you will probably wait a very long time to see someone   This is completely understandable  in my opinion   They ll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call   Occasionally  I ve noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait   This is not a common issue  and I find that  overall  I receive more attentive service here than at any other clinic I ve visited   Be aware that the doctor you want to speak with may not always be available over the phone   Don t be afraid to leave messages with reception   You ll always receive quick assistance 
Updating previous trip  I still would take my kids there but the derma bond sucked  Poor buddy has a scar  Yea  yea   it s in a bad spot  And he s not quite two  read: squirmy     I don t think it s too much to want it all     :  
Great Doctor  Friendly   Attentive  Professional  Funny 
We came here on the holiday  July     This place was great   All the staff were so friendly and helpful   My daughter had ear pain and the nurse we saw was very compassionate and patient with my daughter   He tried to do his best to get the wax loose and out of her ear  but was unsuccessful after multiple attempts   The doctor then came in to assist and immediately was able to remove a huge chunk of wax   We were given prescriptions for antibiotics and went over to Target  in same shopping center  to get those filled   The medication was cheaper at Target than what Med Express quoted us    It was a great place for going to get immediate care while on vacation at the beach   Thanks so much 
Joyce is awesome  Love that this does not hurt at all  We drive from palm harbor to her place  and it well worth the extra time  Her machine is high tech  and the horror stories my friends told me of their experience    makes me love this even more  Love it 
I came here because of the higher rating and they accepted my insurance  My initial visit went well  no complaints on the staff or the doctor at that time    They switched my brand from Acuvue to Air Optix and about   weeks after using the contact I started to experience pain  redness and irritation  I took my contacts out that evening and had red rings around both of my eyes  I tried contacting them via telephone and left a message as well as email  I failed to hear back from them in a timely manner so I reached out to them again and got ahold of them  I simply wanted my contacts switched back to Acuvue and they tried to tell me that it was allergies causing my problems and were insisiting on me keeping Air Optix  Eventually I did get them to agree to switch my contacts back to acuvue    In march I had another eye irritation and I went to Vanderbilt Eye Institue  they told me it was a continued reaction to the Air Optix lenses because I did not give my eyes enough time to heal before applying my new contacts   which was I was not educated on by Music City Optical when I got my new set of contacts  I then reviewed them on facebook at that time    Today           I recieved a response to my review on facebook and a corresponding email stating that I was being slanderous and lying  which was not the case at all  I was simply explaining my experience with Music City Optical 
I could never go to another dentist  I had a traumatic experience with a dentist when I was younger and have always had bad anxiety when it comes to dental work  Dr  Dayley is not only personable and helps calm my nerves but is very good at what he does  I ve had all four wisdom teeth removed by him  and trust him with my teeth  He is the best dentist I ve ever been to  I highly recommend him to everyone I know  My entire family including my parents and younger siblings all go to him as well  The front desk and staff are very welcoming and sweet  Thank you for being the best dentist office 
I was having an bad migraine and felt terrible  When woke up I had a sinus infection and my day was just going awful  I called a few places to try to get a massage in today because I knew indeed it badly  No one had any availability and I stumbled across massage envy on Google and thought to give them a try  Not only were they able to fit me in with the exact specific type I needed  but they also were able to fit my father in at the exact same time  Jen was understanding and nice  she asked me questions and checked up on me constantly  She even showed me some at home techniques I could use  She took her time  obviously did not rush  Carrie  I believe  was the name of the woman who did a foot massage on my father  He was very pleased and recommended I try it sometime  They also informed me about the membership program which not only is very cost efficient  but also adheres to my busy schedule  I signed up on the spot with no hesitation  Friendly staff  great atmosphere  comfortable building and very calming environment  Would recommended  I feel so much better already and am going back in a month to get a    minute massage 
I was new to the Westchase area and I was in need of a new dentist   After reading reviews and the location being on    miles from my place I made an appointment   The entire staff is great   I ve visited with Dr  Creech Gionis  and Dr  Stern  they both are outstanding   They make going to the  dentist less painful   I can honestly say I m      satisfied 
It s been a few years since I ve been here  I was impressed that they had little tvs in the exam rooms for the patients  Now I realize    you can t really watch tv during dental work and    maybe it s a  perk  since the prices are so high   I originally went to get a cleaning exam but was told I needed several inlays which  of course  weren t covered by insurance and were very expensive  The dental work was done well no complaints there  but it s very expensive and was possibly unnecessary 
Moved to Tucson and needed a new dentist  everything went great here 
I had an amazingly positive experience here  Dr  Neel and Robin were friendly  knowledgable and exceptionally helpful  They were patient in answering all my questions  helped me pick out some cool Lucky Brand frames and fitted me for contact lenses  The best optometrist I ve seen  I highly recommend them 
When I returned to pick up my new glasses  I realized that they are horribly out of focus  Apparently they don t measure out the position of the pupils in respect to lenses in order to position the center of focus there  The staff member tried to talk me into repositioning the glasses however for me to see  they would have to be floating on my face and you can only look at he bottom most part  Umm no  Then she stated that she did measure but I don t remember such action being taken   I asked for the lenses to be redone and they promised to send them off as urgent  Well  still no glasses 
I believe the gentlemen at the front desk name was Kris? He was great  the rain was coming down so hard and he went above and beyond and walked me as well as Leo with an umbrella to the car   I have taken Leonidas there for about two years now  unfortunately he is a nervous Nelly  but we started seeing Dr  Deutsch and he has been the best with Leo  He is thorough and takes his time to ensure Leo is comfy 
Wow  What a workout you get in    minutes   I didnt believe it until I tried it  Now I m hooked and feeling better than I have in a long time    Ask for Chelsey  She is great to work with   
Excellent service  Sent a request online and within       mins had a call back  Got the spot scheduled  Shanna was Prompt on arrival  very informative with prevention and such  Checked both mine and my daughters head  Full treatment on both   It is a bit pricey but I already had one round and was over it all  The off the shelf stuff just doesn t work   The comb they use is not available in stores and gathers the nits way better   Only complaint is the comb should be included in the session not extra  I bought it cause I wanted to have the proper tools in case of a next time 
Mandala has everything you need for massage at great prices  Lisa is extremely helpful  knowledgeable  and friendly  She helped me choose several different essential oils from the huge aroma bar and blended them just right for me  It was a fun  interactive experience  Mandala is very affordable  on par  if not less costly  than online prices and you get to test the products in person with no shipping charges  Please consider shopping locally for your massage supplies rather than purchasing them online in order to support this fantastic small business  Note that Mandala has moved to a quaint Victorian style home on South Virginia 
I was in so much pain from my accident  waited for   hours and was seen for   minutes and discharged with no medications to help me recover  If you are looking for a compassionate care  this is not the place to get it 
Probably the most expensive game in town  But totally worth it for me  I upgraded myself to the executive locker rooms because that gives me zero excuses for why I can t go to the gym before work or after if I am going out later that night  I always have my makeup  hair stuff  etc in my locker  Just getting back to the gym after a long absence due to health issues so I m taking it slow  I ve seen one or two machines that are not quite working right but the facility as a whole is pretty sharp   welcoming  You have tons of options of what to do classes wise  equipment wise    My only   down sides are that I wish they were open a little later on weekends  but that s just me moving slowly on my time off  I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule  There are classes I d like to take but they always run mid day  never really early  after work or weekends  So no option to try them  I m sure it s an instructor issue so not likely something that will change  Overall I m super happy that I joined 
So meijer is amazing and so convenient  However  the starbucks is always a hit or miss and the employees don t seem to be trained right because I ve noticed every time they have to pull a sheet out to see how much it is and its never the same price   my drink wasn t good at all this morning and when i told the lady it didn t look right she poured some of my drink out and just put more milk in it to make it taste better  Wasn t really wanting to pay    for a cup full of milk but she didn t seem to care so why bother even saying anything   : 
Great customer service  Mary was a great help  helped me pick out frames and she was extremely personable  From the time I walked in the store  I was greeted with smiles and hellos  I will be back in the future 
I ve only been here to pick up an outpatient  my father   I was greeted warmly  right away  and though he has a difficult last name  the receptionist had no problem finding him   She even told me that he was a great patient  funny and cheerful   She told me to have a seat and that he d be out soon   He was out in approximately   minutes happy and mostly pain free from the injection he received   I wouldn t be able to give this facility a full review  but they treated me well while I waited 
Okay  first review  and I don t even live in Philly anymore  But now in Houston  I m feeling the loss    I d say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a   star review  First  the impersonal stuff  Modern office  computerized charting  accurate scheduling  I was never kept waiting   the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at  convenient location  Can t think of anything that s lacking  She shares her office with another doctor who I haven t met   The second category is the personal aspect  When I showed up the first time as a new patient  she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person  Sweet  In all subsequent visits  that never changed  Without going into medical details  she herself called me when the results came in for some minor  and false  tests    All in all  I can t imagine a better doctor  Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn t live for any length of time?
Both Dr  Lam and Colleen treated me fantastically in filling a couple of old cavities  They did it quickly and without any pain and with much good humor  I highly recommend this office for any dental work you need done  It s worth traveling to the City even if you don t live there    Rob S 
I am new to Philly  and heard about Lauren and her community acupuncture within a month of living here  I love it  Lauren is so attentive  energetic  and nurturing  I have come in for various reasons  and Lauren has been able to provide relief every time  She is also been very responsive to follow up questions and concerns I send her via email   I am very fond of the community aspect as well  The treatments are so affordable  and you get to be in a space with other people who are looking for healing and well being also   I feel lucky to have found Lauren and her space   a true sanctuary in the city 
This place is awesome  Had to come here on the first day of our honeymoon because I got bronchitis  The doctor told me he would fix this and he did  Everyone here is so nice  I definitely recommend this place 
My care at Temple has been so great that I am very hesitant to go outside of the system for any doctor  I also work for the organization and believe in the judgement of the professionals here  I ve seen how much they place the patient at the center of what they do  Since moving from Massachusetts to Philadelphia  I ve received care from some organizations and cannot compare the care and attention I receive at Temple to anywhere else 
Mary is the best   She is very very knowledgeable in conditions and is a master herbalist   i love all the extra services too  
I went the the spa and I thought it was great  The wait was slightly long because there was only one person working there  other than the receptionist   But she threaded my eyebrows and I couldn t have been happier with the outcome  All my friends were extremely satisfied with it too  and she was definitely an expert because she knew that one of my friends had sensitive skin and therefore how to thread it 
This place is amazing  I ve gone for both the chiropractic services and the massages  and I highly recommend both  Before coming to Quest  I had never been to a chiropractor before  and I wasn t sure how I would like it  but Dr  Jeremy is great  I definitely feel a huge difference in my back and shoulders after leaving   I ve also been to several massage appointments with Heidi  and she does an incredible job  By the time I leave a massage  I feel like my back and shoulders are a thousand times looser and more relaxed than when I came in  She s really open to customizing the massages to your specific problem areas    we always spend most of the time working on back  shoulders  and neck because those areas are where most of my tension is  The office is also a really calm and relaxing atmosphere for getting a massage    it s very quiet and peaceful   I d highly recommend Heidi and Dr  Jeremy 
There aren t too many spas advertising a couples  massage   This was a good choice  if not the least expensive   Small spa  elegant atmosphere   They offer Swedish massage   but any pressure you want     Free parking is included   They ll complete your experience with  a glass of  champagne and  one piece of  chocolate 
Great experience   I went in for a routine cleaning and found the facility to be very clean and modern on the inside   The hygienist was extremely friendly and helpful  and the doctor who performed the exam was also very informative and friendly   I was there about    minutes early and was taken in right away  with the entire process only taking about    minutes    It was great experience  and I ll come back again 
As a scared mom of one who was told that the birth I desired is  archaic   by my doctor  I felt hopeless  I thought my only solution this go round was to repeat the same overly medicated birth I experienced last time where they told me what to do and I had no say in the matter  I found Rebecca via the web and she came so highly recommended I had to at least speak to her  Her flexibility made me instantly fall in love  She met me via Skype  my request  and was so sweet and knowledgeable I knew she was the doula for me  despite the many others I d interviewed   From that moment on I ve been soaking up her knowledge and leaning on her for support  When I went into labor and couldn t even open my eyes her voice made me so calm Bc she created such a safe soothing space for me  ensuring whispered voices and dimmed lights  She was able to bestow more knowledge on us in that setting than any of the nurses on staff  She is literally a genius when it comes to birth  She has so many tactics and means to provide the best support  She is still my go to for any mommy concerns  She is always there and always reassuring  Gosh  I love her  She is very affordable and provides so much expertise that I truly don t know why she doesn t charge more  When I had to leave the state for a family emergency within weeks of my due date she found me not just a back up doula  but also a hospital that does water births  She found me a medical practice that supported my birth choice here in Atlanta  Thanks to her educating me I was able to have the birth I always wanted and didn t know was possible  I am amazed that I did that but humbled Bc I know that I couldn t have done it without her 
Been pumping iron here for years  Love the new location  Great rates  and a nice facility to get your sweat on   I really appreciate the community feeling I get from the staff and people who work out here   Keep up the good work E F 
Please do not bring your loved one to this hospital  they use their patients as guinea pigs and staff have little regard for the privacy and dignity of patients even if they require critical care  My auntie is struggling to stay alive and when my mom stayed with her just two days ago mom had to stand in the room with her the entire time because there were no chairs  When she asked the nurse for a chair the nurse rudely responded that they couldn t accomodate everyone in the hospital  We are looking into transferring my auntie out of this terrible place 
Dr  Fox has a phenomenal bedside manner   He is so genuine and kind  but also knowledgeable   He helps explain things in terms his patients can understand and relate to  but not in a condescending way   When I went to him I was so upset with a chronic illness I had  I felt really depressed over it   But Dr  Fox helped explain it and put it into perspective  and had an optimistic outlook on my treatment and I immediately felt better   Here I am six years later feeling much better  thanks to his guidance 
I m coming up on my  nd anniversary of regularly visiting Springtime Fitness  and it seems high time to write a review  When I moved into this neighborhood and stumbled upon Springtime  I was pretty out of shape and suffering from chronic back pain  Enter Lisa  She is a fantastically knowledgable instructor with a keen eye and deep knowledge of body mechanics  She worked with me to develop proper alignment  core strength and flexibility  Over the past two years  I ve gotten strong  my posture is better  my stamina has improved significantly  And  my core  leg and arm strength have made me much more resilient   I ve even started running again  haven t done that for years   Over the two years at Springtime  I ve expanded my fitness regime to include training on Red Cord with Peter Madden  and on Gyro with Joyce Chen  This is all in addition to the still challenging Pilates work outs with Lisa   It s great to be able to engage in a dynamic fitness program that constantly challenges and evolves to keep me growing and improving  Plus the space has tons of natural light and a bank of windows with a private garden view   lovely  So  thank you Springtime Fitness  Lisa  Peter and Joyce  and happy anniversary 
Dr  Todd is the best  I started going here about three months ago and I have noticed such a big difference    I had broken my back in two places and have suffered from back pain for years  After seeing Dr  Todd I have noticed a difference in my flexibility and have not had the aching pain that I have dealt with on a daily basis  Dr  Todd is super friendly and truly listens to what is going on with YOU    He is very flexible with scheduling and their prices are so reasonable  I have recommended him to many friends and family  He has truly made a big difference in my life and I am grateful   
I have to be honest  I was a little skeptical going into the    minute workout because all my life I ve never been told you only need to workout    minutes a week  After doing my first    minute workout with Quantify Fitness my mind was blown  I left feeling like I ran   miles and then some  I was sore for days after and it honestly was the best quick workout I ve ever done  I ll definitely be going back 
I love love love facials with Becca at this beautiful spa  she is very professional and  knowledgeable on skincare along with Rescue s product lines  She makes me feel at very comfortable since I am seriously self conscience about my problematic broke out skin lately  I now use and purchased what Becca wrote out for me  Worth every penny; Lait U wash  PF   toner  cream demopurifiante and mask vivant  She has given me hope again for clear skin  she also showed me how to apply with an upward motion and use baking soda once a week mixed with vivant for this face  Thank you Becca   Rescue see you all again soon  xoxo
Why is it that ALL Anthros have dressing rooms that seem lit by a candle on the verge of flickering out?  The longer dresses on the first floor are usually amazing   The rest   well  there are no must have items anymore  Lack of essential wearability usefulness seems to be hitting a lot of women s clothing stores these days 
I just had the best pedicure with Gina  She made sure to get all of the rough spots and my heels have never been so smooth  It was worth every penny  Definitely going back 
Oh RESCUE it did  and has    This is my go to place when I want to indulge in a truly fabulous facial   For the reasonable ish price of      the hour long Classic Rescue Facial leaves you fresh and revitalized   and your skin feels like a baby s bottom  that is clean  of course    I ve gone to Rescue for a couple years now  and I ve had a few deep tissue swedish massages  no complaints   but mostly facials     The  nd floor space   the building is at   th and Latimer  go in the lobby  take the elevator one floor up  is open  clean  bright  spacious and modern with dark wooden floors   It feels  smells and looks like a spa  My five senses give Rescue thumbs up   The treatment rooms themselves are really nice and roomy and lit just right  Some rooms have pretty chandeliers or have small candles   Sheets  robes and all the accoutrements are clean and soft   Staff are polite  casual and down to earth   If they re not busy or booked back to back  they ll offer you some delicious what have you infused water or beverage of your choosing   I hear their makeup artist on staff is really good   and I ve seen her do her thing on occasion  she works on her clientele right there in the open  so you get to watch   Few drawbacks  never had a mani pedi here  so I can t attest to the quality or whether they re worth it  but word to the wise  like other reviews have mentioned  there are no pedi chairs   just basically a wooden bench with some loose pillows   which doesn t strike me as relaxing or remotely comfortable    Also  the changing rooms are basically non existent  One for women and one for men   which leaves you with no privacy if you want to change and shower at your leisure   There s nothing calming about waiting for the change room to free up or rushing to change or shower so someone else can get in   what is this  a YMCA?   On busy weekends  the waiting areas tend to fill up too   so it can get a little  packed    Lastly  some of the esthesticians have a tendency to really push their products   which I hate and find annoying especially when I m already spending good money getting a treatment     so buyer beware  as the line of products they carry are pretty expensive   But cons  aside  I ll still go back to Rescue and look forward to trying out other treatments 
I ve been going to Boise Therapeutic Massage for   years now   I m giving it   stars because I can always get an appointment the day I call  every therapist is exceptional  and the price is reasonable   I ve never been disappointed   It isn t a fancy spa but their clinic is relaxing and the staff makes you feel welcome and I go for the massage and not the spa experience anyway   I ve started going to Amy exclusively for all my massages  It s wonderful when you find someone who knows where your trouble spots are and can make you feel human again 
I came in to the store to get a prescription for contacts   The exam was quick and painless  and I didn t have to wait at all  I had an appointment    The staff are friendly  knowledgeable  and they don t try to  sell you  like some other places   They provided me with multiple contact lens brands to try  and they were helpful in finding the right contacts for my eyes 
I have been taking my children here for over   years now and have Never had a problem  When my daughters are sick it takes minutes to get a sick visit  The front desk staff are true professionals  I KNOW dealing with the public can be trying  add sick children and excited parents   well some days can be trying  But these guys are always polite  The care given by the doctors  Dr  Carrier Kinsley    N A  s is Outstanding  As a single mom  I got a lot of irons in the fire most days  but these guys keep me on track with daily reminders about appointments  need shots etc  I also Love that I can now access my children s records  doctor s visits  etc  online  Even with the much noted growth of the office over the years  I still feel good from the individual and special care my children receive here 
I ll start this long overdue review by stating that Children s Hospital saved my infant son s life in April this year   Born at East Jefferson General Hospital  my son was quickly transferred to Children s Hospital New Orleans  CHNOLA  with a life  threatening illness   We found ourselves in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  NICU  and I can honestly say that this is one of the best units in the hospital  Our son was immediately assessed and within a few hours  was already being tested to diagnose his condition   Within   hours and after a host of tests  our son was diagnosed and assigned a neonatologist    separate specialists and a nurse    His treatment began immediately and we spent nearly a month in the NICU   Parents are allowed to stay at their child s side with the exception of shift changes from  :    :   am and  :    :   pm   I hope no parent ever has to experience what my wife and I felt  but looking back now  we can honestly say that the NICU is the best unit unit in the hospital; and we have visited many of the clinics there for his follow up visits   We spent every single day with our son and got to personally know every doctor and nurse assigned to him for the day   It takes a special doctor or nurse to work in the NICU  and the nurses are like angels   The NICU nurses  for lack of a better term  are like surrogate parents to the sick children they care for   It is more than a job to them   Watching them care for my son and his roommate  most NICU rooms are double occupancy   I quickly learned that the nurses are totally committed to their patients   Many of the children in the NICU are from cities across the state and some parents can only come to visit on the weekends as they have to work to pay their bills  But the nurses hold them and rock them and talk to them as if they were their parents   Seeing them in action is a humbling experience  but an experience I hope that none of you ever experience   We have only had to visit the E R  twice and it is a top notch facility   However  there are so many patients waiting to be seen  every day  that the wait can easily exceed     hours   What s worse is that many of the patients and their parents are coughing and possibly spreading germs throughout the E R   If you do find yourself in the E R   I would suggest waiting in the hallway with your child while he she is waiting to be seen   Hopefully you can avoid leaving with an illness that you didn t arrive with   Once a patient is discharged from CHNOLA  they are often assigned to follow up visits at one or more of the hospital s many clinics  One of the most overworked clinic is the hemotology oncology clinic   If you ever find yourself a patient of this clinic  make sure you bring at least   or   extra bottles for your child as the wait time from checking in  to triage  to lab and then being seen in the clinic can easily exceed   hours   Everyone there on their staff is very nice   However  the staff is completely overworked and booked solid from  :   am to  :   pm   Do yourself a favor and book the earliest appointment you can   You ll be glad that you did   On a more positive note  I have nothing but great things to say about both the occupational therapy clinic and physical therapy clinic   Both clinics are appointment only and if you are late  you are not allowed at all to infringe upon the next patient s time slot; which is the way it should be   The therapists are are great and are truly excited and enthusiastic about their jobs; and it shows   Many of the patients in CHNOLA are there for a long time  and ther parents often spend time in hotels occasionally so that they can spend more time with their child without having to go home   The CHNOLA cafeteria offers deeply discounted meals to parents of admitted patients  and we spent a solid month eating breakfast  lunch and dinner there   It s just a small way for the hospital to offer something back to the parent  and the food is actually quite good   I gues the best thing about CHNOLA is the attitude of the staff   Overall  everyone is extremely nice and sympathetic to your needs   Most parents are already in a fragile state and the staff recognizes this and does their best to accomodate you     The only reason I don t give it   stars is because of the extremely long wait times in some of the clinics   Hopefully through the yearly telethons  donations and possiible government assistance  the hospital can obtain the necessary finding to increase its staffing relative to its patients needs 
I have been seeing chiropractors and receiving chiropractic care for years   I recently started going to Reno Family Chiropractic    Upon my first visit  I was greeted by a very friendly and professional staff   I was introduced to Micky R  Doyle  who then proceeded to give me a full and detailed evaluation and adjustment    In just the two months I have been going here  I can feel a difference in my every day life with my lower back pain staying at bay most of the time   Overall a great place  flexible scheduling   friendly  and professional 
I just got home from Rescue and felt I had to post a review  I had a manicure and pedicure with Sally and let me tell you   she is a real professional  Her attention to my nails  trimming  filing  nipping  and polishing  is second to none  She carefully shapes my nails just the way I like them and is cautious not to over buff  My polish stays on until she takes it off the next week  which considering what I put my nails through is unbelievable   I know I just shot myself in my beautifully pedicured  foot  as I will never be able to get in with her again  Going to Rescue is not just about getting services done  it is an experience in its  self   There are pros and cons in every spa but the fact is Rescue Rittenhouse Spa is for people who are serious about having the best there is 
This is for the University  Faculty  Club s dining room  open mainly to members who are part of IUPUI s faculty and staff   Menu here:  https:  universityclub iupui edu Reservations Weekly Menu  Excellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer  for a buffet lunch   The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates  and also served us whenever we requested  we asked that   portions of the red velvet cake be split   ways  and the result was prompt and precise  with extra small plates    She was cheery and interacted with us professionally  even if this wasn t  I don t think  a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys   The menu itself feels as if it s trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget   A couple of salad y items including cornbread salad  a lively green  spinach  salad  and   other choices  plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle   A couple of starches then proteins including a savory sweet tofu entry  it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home  but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a  kalbi  meat thing which was sweet and savory  soy sauce style  and kinda clumpy  but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options  uh  fish?    Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment  I guess   Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated  even if the textures were not excellent   My guess is they re operating with limited funding and staff  but there s some smart guy or gal doing the menu design  trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn t taste mass produced  but that also doesn t violate their financial dictates   The food was tasty  not old  and satisfying without being too sweet  oily  or salty   Pretty good job  all said 
Terrible  Rude service  and very dirty  Floors had trash on them  The bathroom that I used had water  or some other substance  on the floor   I was pregnant and taking the glucose tolerance test which takes a long time  I had to use the bathroom often  I was scolded for using the bathroom because the water was turned off which they apparently do during a urine drug test  I had no idea   and then I couldn t flush the toilet or wash my hands  I wasn t even offered to use another sink  Ridiculous 
These guys are the best  I ve been putting off this filling for about   years and it finally gave in  these guys got me in the same day were quite affordable seeing as I do not have insurance  the staff was lovely as was the dentist  quick and good work  I couldn t thank them enough 
erin is great  gentle n really intune to the patient   she is truly gifted 
Dr  Steele is wonderful   She is extremely easy to get in touch with and is very knowledgeable about the services and products she offers   Fantastic  flexible hours which is great for someone who works a lot and her prices are unbeatable   I was thrilled to find a doctor who offers effective laser hair removal at a reasonable price   She also really spends time with you and it is clear she values her client base   Great atmosphere waiting room complete with massage chairs   Also a note that she uses the ND:Yag which works on all skin types   I saw results even after just one treatment 
Thank goodness someone said don t worry about the number of reviews  I just walked in today and got a hour massage  half hour chair  half hour feet  for      Highly recommend David 
I have been looking for a new dentist for awhile and always saw this one when visiting my bank  I finally decided to try it out with the new patient cleaning x ray special they have and I am very glad that I did  I was having a problem as well with one tooth and didn t know what to expect from a new dentist but I was very happy when Dr Su told me that nothing was wrong with it  I m always nervous when seeing a new Dr in general so its reassuring when they tell you everything looks great  The staff from the time I walked in to the time I left were very friendly and caring and I really liked Dr Su  They all listened to my questions and answered them with sincerity  I would definitely recommend them and can honestly say that I am very pleased that I found my new dentist  Definitely   stars 
The  custom  program prescribed by the doctor is to put you on a    day elimination diet   eliminating eggs  dairy  sugar  grains  legumes  citrus  nightshades and a few other things  certain types of vinegar  etc   I did notice relief of symptoms such as bloating and insomnia during this phase  This phase includes a protein shake and some nutritional supplements made by Xymogen and other reputable companies  Mostly an array of vitamins and amino acids  The rest of the program is basically to recommend a Paleo style eating program with some additional supplementation  The doctor recommended a formulation to help increase my energy levels  the testing results showed me as having severe adrenal fatigue  which he makes and is a liquid herbal tincture taken under the tongue  Except his office was out of the formulation and it took    days to get  When I did get it I used it as directed for the next month and I lost all the sleep benefits I had gained   I told Dr  Nelson I felt the supplements during the elimination phase seemed to be much better for my body  He poo pooed that idea and kept the supplements the same but reduced the dosages  I never got back to feeling as good as during the elimination diet phase and slowly lost interest in the program as it wasn t doing anything helpful and is incredibly expensive  The program cost is       paid over six months  While I am glad I tried the program and found some limited success during the elimination diet it is hard to maintain that way of eating while working and traveling  etc  I will try to incorporate a mini   day elimination period about once a month though  and do continue to eat primarily grain free  as I am a big believer in the benefits of avoiding all grain  and legumes   For anyone thinking about this program  in my experience it was not worth anywhere near        I still have some lab tests to do to compare with my original results  but the only thing that was  wrong  in my initial labs was adrenal fatigue  which I wasn t surprised by   There are some things the doctor doesn t check for such as Candida and Pyroluria which I would have liked to be included  Also  they really sell the program as a concierge program and encourage you to call or email anytime with questions  My experience was that you got the information by pulling teeth if you got it at all  When I had questions about the lab tests and wondered if the lab tests had included a test for Candida I didn t get a call back from the doctor but rather a call from the office manager telling me she had spoken to the doctor and he said Candida wasn t my issue  I pressed further and she said there was no test for Candida performed in the original labs  So apparently the doctor can just size up your issues without lab tests to back it up 
AMAZING  What can I really say about this place? A LOTTTT  If your not into chiropractor type of things  this place will make you change your mind about it  It doesnt hurt to give it a try  You never know until you try it and EXPERIENCE it yourself  Especially with Dr  Blake  He is the man to go to if you have back pains  neck pains  any issue what so ever just ask away  He is very knowledgeable in what he does  answering everything questions you have for him  Just ask away he doesnt bite  Well not that i know of? JK  LOL The place is a little small  but will still do the job  If you want privacy then close the door or let whoever there knows or you can be like me and not give a care in the world because we all are human beings LOL  Make sure to be clean and freshly showered because its more hands on and physical activities  Loving the adjustment Dr  Blake be working on my neck since im dealing with a lot of pain due to injuries  Makes my neck easier to maneuver and look around since its difficult for me to be doing so  : Just give them a call in advance and ask away  From what they can do to help you and etc  This is actually my first experiencing Chiropractor so far and so far  IM LOVING  it like mcdonalds would say it  Just want you guys to feel the same experience as i did  If you found my review helpful let me know  Let them know its Toe Knee Tony  that sent you if u really think my review was awesome 
I have had many MANY massage experiences in my life no this is absolutely the top of the line  Freedom massage is the best place to get a rub down  This place is very clean  zen  down to earth and relaxing  The owner knows her stuff and goes the extra    miles to make sure everyone has a fabulous experience  From the hand painted thoughtful art on the walls to the divine music to the very talented masseuses  this place completely rocks the entire massage experience  If you have the opportunity make sure to stop by here for an experience of a lifetime 
Dr  Poblete is the best doctor that I have ever interacted with  Every visit  we spend the majority of our appointment with her face to face  No time waiting in the waiting room  She is careful to help us schedule appointments for our baby when toddlers won t be in the office for her health  She answers the office phone line at any time  takes time to talk with us about any concerns  even if we are being overzealous   Then she calls back later to make sure we are still okay   She is very descriptive in all of her explanations and has a wonderful disposition  Everyone s child deserves care like this 
Love love LOVE this place    We moved to the area from out of state shortly before I got pregnant  so I was really hoping to meet some other local pregnant women   I ve been doing the prenatal yoga classes and they are amazing   Abby is a fabulous instructor  and all the women who work at the facility are really friendly and helpful   I felt welcome the second I walked in the door   I ve also been taking their Lamaze birthing class which has been great   Rachel teaches with a perfect mix of  natural  but also giving us a lot of useful medical knowledge   I ve been able to meet a lot of other great pregnant women throughout these experiences and I m so grateful 
Our new  home  pharmacy and drugstore  We were very pleased with the neighborhood CVS  especially conveniently located across the street   Everyone was very courteous and helpful  Thank you for the fine service 
New to the area and needed some freshening up with a trim and layers   Wanted a curly look for the night also   Saw reviews of Megan but was afraid if I asked for her she would be booked   Luckily when I called they offered me Megan so I grabbed it    So glad I did   Megan did exactly what I wanted  curled my hair  told me what she was doing the whole way  and was great to talk to   Megan is my kind of people ;   Very happy to have found my new stylist     YES   
Excellent dentist  caring person  wonderful staff   No waiting  Free street parking  never had a problem finding within a block or so in this South Philly neighborhood   An artist whose work adorns the office and a similarly skilled artist when mending replacing teeth   A Michaelangelo for the mouth      Great pre chemo checkup and care  you can t go to dentist during chemo because it crushes your immune system    Proactively wrote prescription for mouth rinse  for dry mouth or thrush  that might be needed due to chemo reaction   Fortunately  I only needed the over the counter alternative he also recommended  Biotene   Staff seems to remember every detail about people and their issues    caring  lovely  helpful   Is it possible to actually look forward to going to the dentist?  Dr Stern has created a dental oasis   In my experience  accepts dental insurance reimbursement as payment in full   Others charge hundreds more and quality not even as good 
Some recent improvements in the practice:  new digs @  th   Walnut  walk in hours  and u can make appointments on line   There were some recent communication problems between the office   my RiteAid pharmacy   I finally asked for written Rx for all my meds  hand carried them to the pharmacist @  rd   Walnut   Got   month supplies of most w only a small copay   That worked   The practice has  finally  gone totally electronic with patient records   Dr Nizen is a first rate diagnostician  She listens extremely well   I m still very satisfied 
I absolutely love this spa  It is my go to place for getting waxed  They are always quick and less painful than other places  Also they offer you tea or cucumber water when you arrive  It is a very serene and enjoyable atmosphere 
Dr  DeMarino is excellent   He takes the time to explain what he sees and what is causing stress to your body   I always feel better after a visit   Great practice and people 
ABC Dentistry and Dr Singer make a visit to the dentist like going to Disney  The new set up definitely makes kids feel at ease which makes dental appointments so much easier  I would highly recommend this to any parent with a child who is terrified 
I am oh so happy w  Dr  Valez and Dr  Youngblood   I had an emergency from a poor dentist in Philadelphia who made every single filling hurt   I had four  and walked out in loads of pain after I was not numb   I have had     fillings in my life and I have never walked out in pain or had to come back for an adjustment   I knew something was wrong   Dr  Valez was my go to for the second opinion and I wish he was my first dentist I went to in Philadelphia     Malyssa  the front desk personnel is superb and responds to emails and phone calls and is couteous    The dental assistance was also very knowledgable and understood my needs and was empathetic    I am oh so happy at this office  although  I m still in pain from the original dental work    Dr  Valez is very patient and takes time to adjust my bite and mouthguard to ease the pain   After all  shouldn t every doctor do this after a filling?  I would go to either doctor in a pinch     The office is VERY CLEAN    BIG TIP: do your work ahead of time   This practice is out of network for me  but would have cost me less than an in network doctor  for basic cavities    Do yourself a favor and just come here   Malyssa helped me discover this in out network really isn t a big difference   She helped look into all of my coverage and details and called me back immediately 
This was my first visit and will certainly not be my last  I had an eye exam with Dr  Chuong  She was incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable  One of the best eye exams I have had in a long time  The staff was very helpful in selecting a pair of glasses for me  They did not try to push me into buying a more expensive pair of glasses nor did they try and up sell me  I will definitely spread the word  Exceptional customer service  If you need an eye exam new glasses  please take your business there 
Whoa  I feel I must come to their defense  My daughter is    and they were her first and only dentists  I feel their dentistry is fine  I do remember that    years ago the receptionist told me I should change my name to match my daughter s name   so they would know where to apply the check I sent in for payment   which they cashed anyway   Other than that  the care and service has always been good 
Dr Kaplan is smart  knowledgable  and very personable  My wife and I have been coming here for two years  The staff is very accommodating as well  We have seen Dr Charles Kaplan and NP Lana Kessler and are very happy with both of them  Great practice  Highly Recommend 
We walked in off the street looking to see a doctor  There was no doctor in that day but we got to see the PA  She was friendly and efficient  After examining us  she prescribed medications and sent us on our way  We would go back again if needed 
Appointments available as early as  am and as late as  pm  depending on the day of the week  No one likes the dentist  which makes them a little difficult to review  However  I have been going to Friendly Smiles for years and am always satisfied  They work to accommodate your schedule  they have friendly staff and they have great amenities to make your visit as comfortable as possible  The Dentist s name is Dr  Smiley  you can t get much better than that in a dentist 
I went to see Dr  Lake with pretty severe knee trouble  i e  ongoing and increasing pain  popping  cracking when walking  going up down stairs  sitting  etc    Dr  Lake was very nice  but his assistant was a challenge to deal with   Dr  Lake prescribed an MRI  which was denied by my insurance company   My insurance company said the doctor could appeal the decision by writing a letter  so I called the office   Tracy  Dr  Lake s assistant at Premiere  said they would not be willing to write the letter to appeal   When I asked why Premiere wouldn t write the appeal  she said  Talk to your insurance company  and hung up   Headed over to Penn Orthopedics  who said they d get me the MRI
